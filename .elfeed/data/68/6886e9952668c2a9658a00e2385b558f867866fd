<p>I recently noticed a new blog targeting beginner and intermediate
Emacs users - <a href="http://pragmaticemacs.com/">Pragmatic Emacs</a> by
<a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/people/ben-j-maughan/overview.html">Ben Maughan</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re relatively new to Emacs you should definitely check it
out. Knowing how vast the Emacs ecosystem is, I&#8217;m pretty sure that
more experienced Emacs users will also learn a thing or two there.</p>
