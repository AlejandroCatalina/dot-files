<p>Sometimes I pause before talking to someone about Clojure code. Not because I am unsure of the code, but because I am unsure of
how to pronounce the code.  The particular code in question is
Clojure&rsquo;s <em>assoc</em>.  I have heard it pronounced two ways. One is
&ldquo;assosh&rdquo;, the other is &ldquo;assok&rdquo;.  So, to determine it, I decided to conduct a
scientific poll of the Clojure community.</p>

<p>I posted the poll on
<a href="https://twitter.com/gigasquid/status/493891057906896896">twitter</a> to
the Cojure community who follow me.  The control group poll was not viewed
by those who do not follow me, and/or, are not on twitter.</p>

<p>The results were startling.</p>

<ul>
<li>assosh &ndash; 10</li>
<li>assok  &ndash; 8</li>
<li>assose &ndash; 2</li>
<li>Jeremy &ndash; 1</li>
<li>asoaksh &ndash; 1</li>
</ul>


<p>The community is clearly deeply divided on this important question.</p>

<p>After sifting through the raw data, I remembered my statistical analysis and threw out the extremes.</p>

<p>The conclusion was still a stark reality.</p>

<p><em>We do not as a community know how to pronounce assoc.</em></p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>I can only see one way forward.  We must address this as a community.
I propose that the community documentation of <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/">Clojure Docs</a>
and <a href="http://grimoire.arrdem.com/">Grimoire</a> modify their sites to include audio pronunciation like <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/media/british/uk_pron/l/lla/llama/llama_British_English_pronunciation.mp3">this</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, I&rsquo;m pulling for you.  We are all in this together.</p>
