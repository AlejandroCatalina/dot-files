<p>From time to time people ask me about my personal Emacs
configuration. Other just assume that I use
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>. For a very long time my
personal configuration was pretty similar to Prelude - in a way it was
a staging ground for things to go into Prelude eventually (although
changes would travel both ways when Prelude users suggest some cool
things).</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided that in the future I want to do a few things with Prelude:</p>

<ul>
<li>extract as much functionality from it as possible into reusable
packages (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save">super-save</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/crux">crux</a>)</li>
<li>adopt there <a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a></li>
<li>improve the support for Windows (because now I have Windows computer)</li>
</ul>


<p>As part of these efforts I reworked my personal config into something
pretty simple (it&#8217;s a single <code>init.el</code> file) and I&#8217;ve started
experimenting with ideas for the future. Stay tuned for the results!</p>

<p>The config is available
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d">here</a>. Perhaps some of you will
find something useful there.</p>
