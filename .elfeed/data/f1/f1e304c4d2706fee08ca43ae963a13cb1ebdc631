Emacs has the very useful feature of blinking the corresponding left "(" when
   you type its partner ")" (and the same for other delimiters like "[]", "{}"
   etc., depending on the mode). This is very useful for programming, especially
   for languages like Lisp and Scheme and the like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Further help can come from tools like <a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2010/06/automatic-pairing-of-brackets-and.html">autopair</a> or <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">paredit</a> – although the
   latter is a bit too much <i>bondage &amp; discipline</i> for me, many people love it.
<br />
Anyway, recently I discovered a new helper in the quest for balance in
   delimited universe: <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters">rainbow-delimiters</a>. With this package, the delimiters all
   get different colors based on their nesting level. It works wonderfully well.
<br />
Installation is straightforward:
<br />
<ul>
<li>download <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/rainbow-delimiters.el">rainbow-delimiters</a> and put it in your <code>load-path</code>
</li>
<li>add something like the following in your <code>.emacs</code>:
</li>
</ul>
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (<span class="org-keyword">require</span> '<span class="org-constant">rainbow-delimiters</span> nil 'noerror) 
  (<span class="org-keyword">add-hook</span> 'scheme-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode))
</pre>
That's it – of course you'll need to do the equivalent for modes where you'd
   like to enable it. See the screenshot below – maybe a bit <i>too</i> colorful for
   some people, but I like it and I have found it <i>actually useful</i> to see the
   corresponding delimiters without having to move the cursor over them.<br />

I already added some nice Zenburn colors for this to the <a href="https://github.com/djcb/elisp/blob/master/themes/zenburn-theme.el">Zenburn theme for Emacs-24</a>, as can be seen in the screenshot.
