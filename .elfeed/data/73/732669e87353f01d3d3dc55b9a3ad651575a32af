<p>By default in Emacs the <code>Tab</code> key does only indentation. If some major
mode provides completion of some form, you normally have to trigger it
with <code>M-Tab</code>. In most window managers, however, this keybinding is used to
switch between open windows, which makes it a bit hard to use out of the box.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a simple trick to augment the default <code>Tab</code> behavior. Just put
this in your Emacs config:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">setq</span> <span class="nv">tab-always-indent</span> <span class="err">â€˜</span><span class="nv">complete</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, when you press <code>Tab</code> one time it will indent and if you press it
again you&#8217;ll get completion candidates. If the indentation at point is
already correct you&#8217;ll get the completion candidates right away. As an
added bonus - you don&#8217;t really need <code>M-Tab</code> anymore.</p>

<p>Simple and neat! One really has to wonder why this isn&#8217;t the default
behavior.</p>
