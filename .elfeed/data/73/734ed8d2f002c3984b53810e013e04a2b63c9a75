<p>I&#39;m putting together an
<a href="http://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial">interactive ClojureScript tutorial for Light Table users</a>. You
can go through the tutorial by <em>directly evaluating</em> forms in the file
via the Light Table UI Connection.</p>

<p>I hope this can be a collaborative wiki for those people who want to
extend their editor with an extremely capable and powerful programming
language.</p>
