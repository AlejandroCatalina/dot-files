    Maintaining servers falls into two phases: First, bang head until
    server works; second, capture effort into some automation tool like
    Puppet or Chef. Recently, I’ve been playing around with making the
    first phase closer to the second.
    For lack of a better word, I’m calling it <i>literate devops</i>.   <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html">Read more...</a>

    <b>Update 1:</b> I finally got around to troubleshooting <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html#sec-2-1">using Tramp</a>
    references to execute code blocks on remote servers (even those
    behind firewards).

    <b>Update 2:</b> Need another complete example? Check out my <a href="http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/linux-iptables.html">notes
    onsetting up IP Tables</a> (and <a href="http:Technical/Emacs/linux-iptables.org.txt">this org-mode</a> file), where part of the
    file can be executed in the editor in order to see how my machines
    are configured, and the other part is a script that can be tangled
    to a machine and executed to reset to the firewall rules.
