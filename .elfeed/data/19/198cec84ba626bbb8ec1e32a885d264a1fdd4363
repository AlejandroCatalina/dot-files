    Each week, I teach an after school class at my local Middle School.
    Today, while getting ready to present, I switched over to the
    browser tab containing my presentation and waited for the kids to
    take their seats.

    <p>
    One girl raised her hand and asked about a browser tab that showed
    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Emacs-Hackers/">Emacs Meetup</a>. Clearly she wouldn’t care about some old programming
    editor, but I quickly summarized so I could get to the lesson. She
    said she uses it to play snakes. I told her that she probably uses
    something else, as Emacs is just some old editor. She insisted.

    <p>
    She quickly fired up Terminal on the Mac, typed <code>emacs</code>, and
    promptly entered <code>M-x snake</code>... How...how...did you do...know that?
    While I wrote a version of the snake game on my Apple ][ computer
    when I was a kid, I didn’t know that any one had written one for
    Emacs. Huh. Schooled in my editor by a kid.
    </p>

    <p>
    She also typed in <code>telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    She’s now my favorite.
