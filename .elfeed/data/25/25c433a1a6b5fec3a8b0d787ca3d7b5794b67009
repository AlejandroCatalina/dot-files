<p><a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/about">Mickey Petersen</a> just released
<a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/book">Mastering Emacs</a>, the first new
book about our beloved editor, since
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006488.do">Learning GNU Emacs</a>(released
way back in 2004).</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had the time to read the book yet, but being familiar with
Mickey&#8217;s work I have no doubt it&#8217;s outstanding.  That&#8217;s all from me
for now - go buy the book and start mastering Emacs.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong></p>

<p>I hope we won&#8217;t have to wait another decade for the next great Emacs book.</p>
