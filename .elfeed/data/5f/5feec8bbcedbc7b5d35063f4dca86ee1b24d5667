  Things have been rather quiet at emacs-fu - reason for this is that most of my
  emacs hacking time has been spent on <a href="http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/">mu4e</a>, the emacs e-mail client I
  wrote. It's been shaping up pretty nicely, I should probably write some
  emacs-fu posts about it :)
</p>
<p>
  Another interesting pastime (esp. in Europe) is football/soccer, in particular
  the Euro2012 games; long-time readers will remember the <a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.fi/2010/06/worldcup-games-in-your-org-mode-agenda.html">schedule for world cup games</a>; I made a new one for Euro2012: <a href="https://github.com/djcb/org-euro2012">https://github.com/djcb/org-euro2012</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In order to have the games show up in your agenda, make sure the file is in
  your org-agenda-files. If needed, you could add it with something like this in
  your org-mode settings (change the directory path to wherever you have put
  <code>euro2012.org</code>):
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(add-to-list 'org-agenda-files <span class="org-string">"~/org/euro2012.org"</span>)
</pre>


<p>
  One small issue with the schedule is that it uses the central-european summer
  time (UTC+2), and there is no automatic way to adjust times for the local time
  zone. As a work-around, Juan Pechiar provided the following function which makes
  it easy to update all org-timestamps in a file:
</p>



<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span class="org-keyword">defun</span> <span class="org-function-name">update-org-hours</span> (n)
  <span class="org-doc">"Change all org-mode timestamps in the current buffer by N hours."</span>
  (interactive <span class="org-string">"nAdd hours: "</span>)
  (<span class="org-keyword">save-excursion</span>
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (<span class="org-keyword">while</span> (re-search-forward <span class="org-string">"[[&lt;]"</span> nil t)
      (<span class="org-keyword">when</span> (org-at-timestamp-p t)
        (org-timestamp-change n 'hour)))))
</pre>


<p>
  Evaluate this function. After that, you can go to the file with the schedule,
  and give an M-x update-org-hours, provide the offset for your timezone, compared to
  UTC+2.
</p>
<p>
  Let the games begin!
