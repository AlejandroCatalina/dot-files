 <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-a6de0e9f-41f4-172e-ec39-18ef9e51af22"><br /><span>Just today, I finished reading a Signet Classic by George Orwell by the name of </span><span>Animal Farm. </span><span>It was an incredibly interesting book, but the thing about it was it kept getting more and more sad. It reminded me of the human trait that has taken its roots deep within us. Greed. Even ancient people were aware of this trait. Their myth of how humans got to be like this is called Pandora. Summing it up, Pandora wants to see what is inside of a box that she was told not to open, so she opens it. Various ugly monsters emerge from the box, all representing a negative human trait. &nbsp;If you got bit by one of the monsters, you would end up having that trait. It turns out that eventually, everyone gets bitten and passes the traits through eons of generations. One of the monsters was named Greed. </span></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>Old Major, a Middle prize bull calls the animals to a meeting one night after Mr. Jones, the owner of the farm has gone to bed drunk and confused. &ldquo;Old Major was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was willing to lose an hours&rsquo; sleep to hear what he had to say.&rdquo; (pg. 4)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He says that he is getting old and that he wants to share with them a small spark of hope to carry on through generations. A Rebellion. &ldquo;The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is plain truth.&rdquo; (pg. 7)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He makes it clear that when the rebellion starts, the animals must not have anything to do with humans and must equal and not kill. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Three days later, Old Major dies peacefully in his sleep, as warned during his speech. The animals were so excited about the rebellion that they overthrew the farm shortly after. They make 7 sacred rules that all animals must follow called the Seven Commandments. Here they are:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No animal shall sleep in a bed.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No animal shall wear clothes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No animal shall drink alcohol.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No animal shall kill another animal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>All animals are equal.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The animals all agreed on this and chose the pigs to be leaders, owing to the fact that they are the smartest and can read. Life goes on and the animals are all content, but the pigs start to do little acts of luxury such as taking milk and apples for themselves to &ldquo;preserve their health. The acts start getting more outrageous though and all of a sudden the pigs are breaking the Commandments (and changing them) left and right. But the animals think that since the pigs are smart, they must be doing it for a good reason and nobody rebels. By the end of the book almost all of the Commandments were either broken or changed by the pigs. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The pigs actually learned how to walk on two legs</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>3. No animal shall sleep in a bed </span><span>with sheets.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CHANGED AND BROKEN</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pigs &nbsp;took off the sheets and used blankets as to not break the tweaked rule.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>4. No animal shall wear clothes.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>5. No animal shall drink alcohol.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>BROKEN</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pigs were caught by the other animals drinking in the dead of night.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>6. No animal shall kill another animal </span><span>for no reason.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CHANGED AND BROKEN</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There was an incredibly large execution where dozens of animals were killed for very minor crimes by the nine dogs who ripped their throats out.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>7. All animals are equal </span><span>but some are more equal than others.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>CHANGED AND BROKEN</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>At this point, it&rsquo;s kind of obvious why it was broken.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>On the other side of the wall of Commandments, there was also a poem talking about how great Napoleon (the leader pig) was.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But although the whole book got continuously more sad, the last part was what made me almost burst into tears. The pigs met up with some human farmers to eat dinner, drink and talk about the pig&rsquo;s farming tactics. These were the very last words of the book:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;The animals outside looked from pig to man, man to pig again; but already it was impossible to tell which was which.&rdquo; (pg. 141)</span></p>
