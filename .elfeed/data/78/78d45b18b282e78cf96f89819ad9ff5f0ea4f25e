<p>Sometimes I want to create something and I run into a limitation or
constraint. It is at this point where I am tempted to give up and say
that I just <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do that.</p>

<p>At this time,  I remember Maurice Sendak and the origins of <em>Where
the Wild Things Are</em>.  In this <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/arts/sendak.html">interview with Bill Moyers</a>, he explains
how the book was originally titled <em>Where the Wild Horses Are</em>, but he
couldn&rsquo;t draw horses.</p>

<blockquote><p>She was this torrential woman, passionate woman, who could spot talent 10 miles away. I had no education. I did not go to art school. My drawing was so crude. I had shines on shoes like in Mutt &lsquo;n&rsquo; Jeff in Walt Disney. And she saw through that monstrous crudity and cultivated me, really made me grow up. And then, it was time to do my own picture book.</p>

<p>And I came to her with a title that was &ldquo;Where the Wild Horses Are.&rdquo; And she just loved that. It was so poetic and evocative. And she gave me a contract based on &ldquo;Where the Wild Horses Are.&rdquo; And then, it turned out after some very few months to her chagrin and anger, I couldn&rsquo;t draw horses. The whole book would have to be full of horses to make the book make sense.</p>

<p>And when I tried a number of things, I remember the acid tones. She said, &ldquo;Maurice, what can you draw?&rdquo; Okay. Cause she was investing in a full color picture book. That was an enormous thing back then.</p>

<p>And so, I thought well things, things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Limits or constraints cannot hold back creativity.  But it can help
mold it in surprising directions.</p>
