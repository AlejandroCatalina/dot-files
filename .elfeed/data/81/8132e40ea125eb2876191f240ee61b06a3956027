    Had a good time at the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Emacs-Hackers/events/225601726/">Portland Emacs Hackers</a> meetup.
    I couldnâ€™t record my presentation on Magit that night,
    so I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQO7F2Q9DwA">recorded my demonstration</a> of Magit and its ease of rebasing.

    Also, some teammates accidentally pushed a merge into one of our
    repositories at work, so I wrote shortcut instructions on keeping a
    clean, sequential Git history.
