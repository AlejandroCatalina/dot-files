    After many years of teaching Scratch at my local elementary school, I
    decided to start teaching an after-school session at my local Middle
    School. With diverse interests and abilities (not to mention, I&rsquo;m
    considerably more busy during my day job), I thought I would try a new
    approach: nothing.
