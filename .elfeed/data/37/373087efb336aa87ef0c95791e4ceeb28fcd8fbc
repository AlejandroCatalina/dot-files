<p>For the longest time <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Prelude</a>
included the function <code>prelude-goto-symbol</code> (bound to <code>C-c i</code>).
It basically allowed you to jump to any definition in the current source file
using <code>imenu</code> behind the curtains.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve found an even better option - the package
<a href="https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere">imenu-anywhere</a>. It works in a pretty similar
manner but gives you the ability to jump to any definition in any currently open buffer.
That&#8217;s quite handy and it greatly reduces the need to use something like <code>etags</code>.</p>

<p>As an added bonus - <code>imenu-anywhere</code> features helm integration.</p>

<p>This is a very handy package and I encourage you to give it a go!</p>

<p>P.S. Prelude users should simply upgrade to the latest version of
Prelude (it already uses it).</p>
