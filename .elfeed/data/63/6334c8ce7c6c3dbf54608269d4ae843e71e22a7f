    <p>
    I’ve collected some <i>table formatting</i> code for OpenStack’s <code>nova</code>
    command, and placed them in an <a href="https://github.com/howardabrams/dot-files/blob/master/babel/openstack.org">Tower of Babel file</a> that make
    <code>:post</code> commands in org-mode files able to use them.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <code>os-table</code> function, in that file, converts the ASCII tables
    from OpenStack’s CLI into <code>org-mode</code> tables that I can export,
    render, and feed into other code blocks as values. This feature
    came in handy today...
