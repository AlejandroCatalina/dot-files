<p>People who have been using Emacs for a while often develop the desire
to learn Emacs Lisp, so they can customize Emacs more extensively,
develop extra packages and create the ultimate editing experience,
uniquely tailored to their needs &amp; preferences.</p>

<p>There are a ton of Emacs Lisp resources our there, but most people
generally need only one - the official
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html">Emacs Lisp manual</a>. It&#8217;s
bundled with Emacs and you can start reading right away by pressing
<code>C-h i m Elisp RET</code>. If you&#8217;re relatively new to programming in
general you might also check out the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html">Introduction to Emacs Lisp</a>
(<code>C-h i m Emacs Lisp Intro RET</code>), before diving into the manual.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of Emacs Lisp tutorials online, but I&#8217;d advise
against using them, as most of them have never been updated after
originally published and Emacs Lisp keeps evolving all the time
(albeit not as fast as I would have liked it to). That being said,
<a href="http://bzg.fr/learn-emacs-lisp-in-15-minutes.html">Learn Emacs Lisp in 15 minutes</a>
is a short and sweet intro to the language. You can find more online
educational resources on the
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLisp">EmacsWiki</a>.</p>

<p>Trust me on this - any time invested in learning Emacs Lisp will be
time well spent!</p>
