 <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Southern California SoCalGas Gas Company has a leak in their pipeline spraying extremely dangerous amounts of Natual Gas into the air. It's ironic becuase on their website they say:</p>
<p>&nbsp; "Learn how to use natural gas safely and see how we're working to keep our natural gas system operating safely and reliably."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yet they're polluting the enviroment with a gaping hole the size of a baseball field. If somehow that seems small, thats just the hole, beneath there is so much gas. So much infact you could fit all the people in the UK twice with average home space in that huge hole. We're talking 34 million homes could fit in there and with four people per house thats almost a third of the USA.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is a 84 Billion cubic feet underground leak expected to last over seven months before it can get properly resealed. It's a big deal and not an easy one either, the amount of gas it's releasing is equivelant to 7 million cars. The thing I don't get though is why they only told the public almost four months after the leak started.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The only reason they finally confessed was because the headaches, nosebleeds, and awful smell became too much for the public to handle and they wanted aswers. They sent letters to homes to apologise for the smell and side affects, but even then over 1,000 homes want to be relocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is dangerous besides just the smell it also can be flamable and pote</p>
<p>ntialy cause an explosion. For instance people aren't supposed to use cellphones because they could catch fire from the gas. Airplanes aren't supposed to fly near or over it temporaraly because the gas could explode on the engines or at the cite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Reasons like it spewing 100,000 pounds of the gas every hour makes me glad Im an Oregonian.</p>
