    I was asked to speak about <a href="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html">Literate Devops</a> at <a href="http://emacsconf2015.org/">EmacsConf 2015</a>.  Due
    to work and family complications, I knew that I couldn’t physically
    attend. Wait, what year is this!? We should open a can of
    virtualization on this meatspace!  The week before, we tested out
    the technology, and the Furies looked favorable upon me to remotely
    attend a live conference.
    </p>

    <p>
    On Saturday, September 29th at 9:00am, I sat at my large monitor,
    carefully arranged into windows of note taking Emacs, conference
    twitter feeds, the <code>#emacsconf</code> IRC channel ... and of course, the
    live video feed. “This is good,” I thought. No struggling in
    uncomfortable seats to power small-screened laptops. I had all
    the coffee I wanted, and just the way I wanted it too.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first talk, by <a href="http://nicolas-petton.fr/presentations/emacsconf2015">Nicolas Petton</a> (who was also presenting remotely
    from France), illustrated immutable data structures and lazy
    sequencing from <a href="http://twitter.com/howardabrams/status/637676190640156672">Clojure to Emacs Lisp</a>.
    I thought, “This is going to be a great day!”
    </p>

    <p>
    And then <a href="http://twitter.com/howardabrams/status/637692234226233344">it happened</a>. The power went out halfway through the second talk.
    Using the battery and data service on my cell phone, I went to the
    power utility’s web site. Their power outage map was covered in
    red. Estimated time began at 12:50... then 1:30... then 3:00...
    </p>

    <p>
    I panicked and put out a <a href="http://twitter.com/howardabrams/status/637695592404094980">plea for help</a>. I quickly cross town to
    the first friend who responded, to give my talk perched in his
    living room.

    <p>
    My demonstration went <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/emacsconf/v/13477760">well enough</a> (I start at 1:27:00), but I was
    frazzled and the environment on my laptop was less than ideal.  I
    received some very thoughtful compliments, however:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    Your talk on Literate DevOps with Org-Mode was fantastic, and
    everyone was blown away by it. You had a really stressful day, but
    you gave the talk anyway for your fellow emacers, and everyone
    really enjoyed it. I really appreciate the effort it took to go
    through with the talk after your power cut out. An excerpt from IRC
    at the end of your talk:

    The virtual clapping on IRC was pretty humorous:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">
    | 5:41 PM |  &lt;tered&gt; &lt;clap clap&gt;
    | 5:41 PM |  — cestdiego *claps*
    | 5:41 PM |  &lt;python476&gt; &lt;fingerclap&gt;
    | 5:41 PM |  &lt;Caine&gt; great talk
    | 5:41 PM |  &lt;momerath&gt; thanks Howard!!
    | 5:41 PM |  &lt;cestdiego&gt; M-x clap
    | 5:41 PM |  — offby1 stomps feet
    | 5:42 PM |  — python476 flips IKEA desks
    </pre>

    <p>
    While the entire experience was interesting and enjoyable, I just
    wasn’t pleased, and felt my fellow Cultists in the Church of Emacs
    deserved better, so last night, I <a href="https://youtu.be/dljNabciEGg">re-recorded myself</a>. The audio is
    better, but it doesn’t have the questions and answers afterward.

    <p>
    See you all next year at EmacsConf 2016!
