We're getting close to the end of my blog.  After today's entry, I only have three left to write.  After that, I'll only blog anonymously or (more likely) not at all.<br /><br />This is part three of five in my "Programmer's View of the Universe" series.  I struggled for a while with how best to introduce the ideas in this installment, and ultimately opted for a short story.<br /><br />This is a science fiction short story.  It's different from many other sci-fi stories in that it is set in the "near future", but it has realistic schedule estimates.  So unlike 1984, 2001, The Singularity is Near and all the other sci-fi stories that grossly underestimated their project durations, this one is set 1000 years in the future.  I.e., right around the corner.<br /><br />The story is disrespectful to pretty much everyone in the world.  It will create a fantastic shit storm.  This is probably a good time to point out that I don't speak for my employer.  <em><font color="brown">[Edit:  Yay for fiction!  Apparently marking something as fiction placates people.  Nice to know.]</font></em><br /><br />The story is 18 pages (PDF from Google Docs print preview).  That's not unusual for my blog, but I went ahead and published it as a standalone document.<br /><br />I'd encourage you to enjoy it, but I'm old and embittered enough to know better.  You probably shouldn't even read it.  Just wait for someone to summarize it for you.<br /><br />Installments 4 and 5 will not be short stories; they will be regular old blog rants.  In them I will further develop these ideas, and I will also attempt to clear up any gross misconceptions about the story, of which there are bound to be many.<br /><br />My final blog-rant entry is the only one I care about anymore.  I've been working on it so hard that my fingers have started to fail.  It's been tons of fun, aside from the chronic pain.  It's about a neat programming language, and Emacs, and lots of other stuff.  I can't wait!<br /><br />Oh yeah.  Here's the <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=ddv7939q_20gw8h9pcx">link to the story</a>.  I've never done a read-only Google Docs link before, so it's probably broken.  Or editable.  I don't know.  We'll see.<br /><br />This week is going to suck.  People are going to be mad.  Maybe I should take a vacation and come back when the whining is finished.  Can someone email me and let me know when it's all blown over?
