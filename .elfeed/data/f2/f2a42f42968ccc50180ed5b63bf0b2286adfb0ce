<span class="cm">/* PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS COMMENTED-OUT VERSION!
   This is the old version of expand-file-name, before it was thoroughly
   rewritten for Emacs 10.31.  We leave this version here commented-out,
   because the code is very complex and likely to have subtle bugs.  If
   bugs _are_ found, it might be of interest to look at the old code and
   see what did it do in the relevant situation.

   Don't remove this code: it's true that it will be accessible
   from the repository, but a few years from deletion, people will
   forget it is there.  */</span>

<p>Let me check, just how old is Emacs 10.31?  According to
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html">the Emacs timeline</a> Emacs 13.0x was the first public release -
in 1985.  Feel free to study <a class="reference external" href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/src/fileio.c?id=1dcf9a5d2a727913bc53c68756bdaf6db5573671#n1447">the over 30 years old sources</a>, simply
because they’re significantly more readable than what’s making up
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">expand-file-name</span></tt> these days.</p>
<p>Oh and yes, there’s of course been fools who tried removing this.
The comment itself was added <a class="reference external" href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=4887597a1c52b8277eabeb4d9484c75b1bc9429d">in 2001</a> after such an incident.</p>
