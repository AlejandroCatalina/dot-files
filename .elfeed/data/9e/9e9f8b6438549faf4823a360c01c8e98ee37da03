    My daughter read a book about Ada Lovelace, which generated
    discussion about Alan Turing, which generated discussions about
    computers, which showed me how much kids not only donâ€™t know about
    computers, but how unlikely they are to understand <i>the guts
    underneath the icons</i>.

    Over the weekend, I completed my personal hack-a-thon on a project
    to <a href="http://www.floraabrams.com/ada">demonstrate the depths of a computer</a>, but in a simpler way.
    I may give it to my after school computer club that I run at a local
    middle school.

    Pretty simple as my entire assembly language parser was written as a
    single <code>reduce</code> function.
