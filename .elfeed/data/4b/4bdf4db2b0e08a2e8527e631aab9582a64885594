<p>I&rsquo;ll be talking about the evolution of CIDER at the
<a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">conj</a>, but I won&rsquo;t be able to show much (in
terms of features) during my talk. Luckily, however, beside the talks
we also have the option for <a href="https://github.com/cognitect/clojure-conj/wiki/Clojure-conj-2014-Unsessions">unsessions</a>. Here&rsquo;s my proposal for one such unsession&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to do a more extensive demonstration of the general
workflow with CIDER and all the cool things we&rsquo;ve done recently and
I&rsquo;d also like discuss with our users (and potential users) existing
problems, ideas for improvements and the future direction of the
project. If you like my idea you can show your support for it
<a href="https://github.com/cognitect/clojure-conj/wiki/Clojure-conj-2014-Unsessions#cider-demoqa">here</a>.</p>

<p>Feedback is important and I&rsquo;d like to get as much as possible
to make CIDER better!</p>
