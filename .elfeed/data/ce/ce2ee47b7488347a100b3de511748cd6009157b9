 <p>I've obviously made this very clear on this blog that the reason I do all this climate work is because this is my future. This is what many other climate groups have in mind when they volunteer, but very few of them actually have it in their names. NextGen Climate is all about fighting for a good future for their kids. Their main focus is energy and solar power in the USA and the specific goal that they are working toward is 50% clean energy by 2030 and 105 clean energy by 2050!</p><p>Sounds like a hefty goal, right? I think so too, but if we work hard at it, it could be possible! "The goal is 50% clean energy by 2030. So what are we waiting for?!" ~Tom Steyer: founder of NextGen. Along with solving the climate crisis, Tom is also excited about creating new jobs with renewables; just like President Obama. He predicts that by using clean energy, it would create EIGHT TIMES MORE JOBS!!! That is a LOT of jobs! Americans could also save $40 BILLION on their electricity bills and it could create millions of jobs. And finally, it's also supported by the majority of the country which kind of definetilly 100% totally means that this should be put into action. Thank you NextGen for making my future a bright one. ~Jeremy Check out their website: https://nextgenclimate.org/ Sign the pledge: https://nextgenclimate.org/50by30/</p>
