<p><a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee">JDEE</a> (Java Development
Environment for Emacs) used to be best way to develop Java apps in
Emacs a while back. It offered a ton of
<a href="http://emacswiki.org/emacs/JavaDevelopmentEnvironment">cool features</a>,
like smart auto-completion and a debugger. Unfortunately at some point
the development slowed down significantly and the project went in a
catatonic state. There was pretty much no activity for years in the
official SourceForge repo and there was also no support for features
introduced in Java 5+.</p>

<p>Recently, however, the project migrated to
<a href="https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee">GitHub</a> and it&#8217;s now way easier
to get involved. Seems that some people have already started work on
updating JDEE to support modern JDKs and modern Emacs functionality.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a really exciting project, as Java support has traditionally
been a weakness of Emacs and I&#8217;m writing this post with the hope that
more people will help make JDEE great again.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? If you&#8217;re into Java and friends (Scala,
Clojure, Groovy, etc), check out the new official repo and let&#8217;s get
this party started!</p>
