    I have played with a lot of window managers, and while many claim to
    be unobtrusive and minimal, I really just want Emacs in full-screen
    mode. So,  I create an <code>.xinitrc</code> file that contains only:
    </p>

    <pre class="example">
    exec emacs
    </pre>

    <p>
    That&rsquo;s right, folks, <b>Emacs is my window manager</b>.
