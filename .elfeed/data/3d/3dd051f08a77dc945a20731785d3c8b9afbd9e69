    For your own projects, you can commit to Git anytime, but one of
    the advantages of committing frequently is sharing code...either to
    your team mates or even to yourself. Best approach, however, is to
    commit a single bug or feature at a time, but use Gerrit to make
    sure that single commit is perfect.
