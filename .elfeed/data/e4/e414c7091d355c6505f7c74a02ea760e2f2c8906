<p>Last December, I <a href="/2014/12/10/write-only-social-media/">blogged</a> about taking
it easy on social media over the holidays. This is a post on how it went for
me.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>For the most part, I kept true to my promise and kept away from social media.
It took a little patience to kill my muscle memory, but with the help of a
liberal <code>hosts</code> file, I was able to persevere.</p>

<p>Here’s the hosts file snippet I ran with:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext">127.0.0.1 reddit.com
127.0.0.1 www.reddit.com
127.0.0.1 hckrnews.com
127.0.0.1 news.ycombinator.com
127.0.0.1 cbc.ca
127.0.0.1 cbcnews.ca
127.0.0.1 winnipegfreepress.com
127.0.0.1 linkedin.com
127.0.0.1 www.linkedin.com
127.0.0.1 facebook.com
127.0.0.1 twitter.com
</pre>
<p>On my phone, I played around with some “blocking” programs, including Apple’s
own content filtering, but ultimately found they either didn’t work (3rd
party), or were too restrictive (Apple). That left me with two orthogonal
options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete apps (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit)</li>
<li>Just don’t go to those websites. (Admittedly, this took some willpower, but
it’s hard to develop muscle memory for typing out long URLs on iOS, anyways.)</li>
</ul>

<p>When I initially set out on this endeavour I had two goals; spend more time
with family, and get more done. I can say I succeeded on both of those counts.
There was plenty of time to play and enjoy my family, and whenever I hit a pang
of boredom I broke out the ole’ bucket list.</p>

<p>All in all, I stayed in shape, read some (long dusty) books, hacked on side
projects, and managed to get a ton of “winter cleaning” tasks out of the way
(including digitizing ~200 receipts for my taxes next year).</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>I’ll admit it. Some cheating happened. It wasn’t too bad on my computer, where
uncommenting and DNS-cache clearing is a little cumbersome. No, where it bit me
most was on the phone.</p>

<p>You know how visits to the in-laws can be. Lots of people. Lots of kids/pets.
And, worst of all, lots of stress. I took it as an acceptable loss to browse
Reddit here or there on the can while at the in-laws&hellip;</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Would I do it again? Definitely. I still haven’t returned to Facebook, and
gained a healthy habit of asking “is there anything that needs doing?” before
reaching for a time-filler. I expect I’ll keep the pipe partially closed for
the next little bit, and maybe re-engage <em>full-stop</em> when I need a period of high
productivity.</p>
