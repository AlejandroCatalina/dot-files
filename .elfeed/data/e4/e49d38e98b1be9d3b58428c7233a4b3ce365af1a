<p>As I expect is true of many of us working on the web today, social media is
both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, we get immediate access to news,
enjoyment and our peers. On the other, it is a constant source of distraction.</p>

<p>Being fed up with the latter, I decided to make a change. December is a busy
month. One filled with friends, family, and the elusive never-finished &ldquo;Winter
Project.&rdquo; What role do sites like Hacker News, Reddit and Facebook fill in the
holiday void? None, really. They&rsquo;re just a way to kill time.</p>

<p>There is family unvisited, books unread, projects unstarted, photographs
untaken, and wood unworked&ndash;all of which are inhibited by killing time on the
web. To fix this, I&rsquo;ve decided to make my holiday season a &ldquo;write-only&rdquo; month.</p>

<p>If you read this blog or follow me on Twitter, you&rsquo;ll continue to see updates
from me. I&rsquo;ll even respond to comments and replies. What I won&rsquo;t be doing,
however, is spending any time reading timelines and the like (well, I&rsquo;m
blocking myself from them, actually&hellip;).</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it, much ado about nothing. The only other thing I&rsquo;ll say, is maybe
you should consider a write-only month too. While it might feel like you&rsquo;ll
miss something important, let&rsquo;s be honest, you probably won&rsquo;t.</p>
