<p>Without a doubt <a href="http://www.lighttable.com/">Light Table</a> is now one
of the most popular
<a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> applications
in the world. It&#39;s also likely one of the most complex at around
11,000 lines of ClojureScript.</p>

<p>I think Light Tablers looking to extend their shiny new environment
might first consider reaching for JavaScript. I challenge them to give
ClojureScript a very serious consideration before doing so.</p>

<p>To encourage users of Light Table, Clojure, and ClojureScript to get
to know their tool better, I&#39;ve put together an
<a href="http://github.com/swannodette/hello-cljsc">interactive guide to the ClojureScript analyzer and compiler</a>.</p>

<p>I think exploring a compiler should always be this simple and
interactive.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
