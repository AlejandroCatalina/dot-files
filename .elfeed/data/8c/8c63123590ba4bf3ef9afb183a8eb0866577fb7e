  I'm a fairly busy person, and need to keep track of a lot of things. That
  includes following a bunch of internal IRC channels, attending meetings, meeting
  deadlines and so on. But I don't want to stare at my <code>org-mode</code> calendar, or
  flip through <a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2009/06/erc-emacs-irc-client.html">ERC</a> buffers all the time. 
</p>
<p>
  Instead, I'd like to have one little emacs frame (window) that gathers these
  ('events'), and transfers me to wherever the event came from when I click it - some
  IRC-channel in ERC, my org-calendar etc.  and other inputs. Note, using
  <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org">Bitlbee</a>, you can include Facebook-contacts, GoogleTalk-buddies and
  Twitter-tweets, &hellip; in ERC - so, you can track just about <i>anything</i>.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, with so many inputs, I'd also like the possibility to filter out unwanted
  events, and generate various light/sound effects and fireworks, proportional
  to the priority of the event.
</p>
<p>
  For all this, I wrote a little emacs-tool called <b>Sauron</b> that does just
  that. <code>M-x sauron-start</code> pops up a frame that receives events, and <code>M-x sauron-stop</code> hides it and stops listening. It works with <code>ERC</code>, <code>org</code>, and
  listens for <a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2009/01/using-d-bus-example.html">D-Bus messages</a>; so it's pretty easy to get events from all over
  the place.
</p>
<p>
  It's a bit of a balancing act to get all the important information while not
  being swamped in noise, but Sauron allows you to fine-tune it to whatever
  works the best for you. I've tried to have sane defaults though, so things
  should mostly work without too much configuration - but if you need the power,
  it's there.  I also added some convenience functions to make it easy to get
  sounds and other special effects.

<p>
  So - it's brand new, it is of <i>seems-to-work-for-me</i>-quality, and I'd like to
  invite others to try it out, hack it, give feedback, add new back-ends and so
  on &ndash; what better Christmas present to ask for!
