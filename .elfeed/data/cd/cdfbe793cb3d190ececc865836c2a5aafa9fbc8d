  I tend to do a lot of file management from the shell (<code>zsh</code>, in my case); this
  is very flexible / powerful and so on. But, for some things a bit more
  graphical approach is nicer.
</p>
<p>
  There are fully graphical file-managers like <i>Nautilus</i> or <i>Thunar</i>, but for a
  bit more keyboard-friendly file-management, there are so-called <i>orthodox file   managers</i> - the archetypical Norton Commander and its descendants, like
  <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org">midnight-commander</a> (mc) and <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/gcmd/">gnome commander</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Not surprisingly, emacs has its own incarnation - it is called the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sunrise_Commander">sunrise commander</a> and happily it's obtainable through <a href="http://emacs-fu.blogspot.fi/2011/11/package-management-revisited.html">ELPA</a>. It's become an important
  of my workflow. When you're used to Midnight Commander, you'll feel right at
  home.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to use <code>emacs</code> for <i>yet another</i> of your computer-based
  activities, give it a try.
