<p>As you probably know, there&rsquo;s always lots of new and exciting developments in
Clojure-land. One, more recent technique that has me really excited has been
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5HyVUPuU0E">Simulation Testing</a>.  I&rsquo;ve used
<a href="https://github.com/Datomic/simulant">Simulant</a> to implement simulation tests
on a few projects this last year with great success, and I&rsquo;m really curious to
hear about if/how others are using the technique.</p>

<p>To that end, I&rsquo;ve put together a survey on sim-testing–<em>The State of Simulation
Testing</em>–that I hope can become an annual fixture both inside and outside of the
Clojure community. Once the ballots have closed on February 20th, I&rsquo;ll tally
and report upon the results on this blog.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve considered, implemented or even out-right rejected simulation
testing, I&rsquo;d love to hear more from you:</p>

<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
