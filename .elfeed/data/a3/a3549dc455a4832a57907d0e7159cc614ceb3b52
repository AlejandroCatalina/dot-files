<p>There is a <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/76571/emacs?referrer=S-avym6ycbPzEQTGEFwH_Q2">proposal</a> for a separate Emacs site on the popular StackExchange
network.  It needs your help!  Please commit to it in order to bring it to beta!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>StackExchange is a popular network of Q&amp;A sites, frequented by many Emacs
users.  Currently, Emacs questions are scattered over different sites, such as
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> or <a href="http://superuser.com">SuperUser</a>.</p>

<p>A separate Emacs site would be a single place for all your Emacs questions,
where Emacs power users are there to help you!</p>
