    After reading the Wired article, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/on-the-joy-of-mastery">Why We Should Design Some Things to
    Be <i>Difficult</i> to Use</a>, I finally realize that Emacs <i>should</i> be hard
    to use, and we really should just give up changing it to be easier
    for new-comers.

    This quote sums up my 20 year experience with Emacs:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    [Fujifilm took] the controls out of deep menu functions and putting
    them back on chrome knobs that just beg to be twiddled.
    </p>

    <p>
    I bought a Fujifilm X100 two years ago. It was the first piece of
    technology I’d bought in 15 years where I had to read the
    manual. Actually, I’ve read the manual at least four times. Now I’m
    taking the best pictures of my life, and I love it. By being hard to
    use, my X100 made me a better photographer.

    Seems like Emacs users are now in some elite club where the hazing
    ritual amounts to learning Lisp. Consequently, I’ve decided to start
    signing all my Emacs-related correspondence with:

    Yours in Emacs,
