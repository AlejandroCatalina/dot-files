# dotfiles

Run `./bin/dotfiles` to install. Will prompt for overwrites.

`dotfiles` will link anything in this directory with a name
which ends with a dot (.):

  * if it is a directory, it will be linked, without the dot, 
    in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, or `$HOME/.config` by default.

  * if it is a regular file, it will be linked into `$HOME`, with
    the dot moved to the front.
